    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Biang Biang noodles are a <strong>belt noodle</strong> native to china. It consists of wide and thick
    noodles that are first covered in spices and aromatics, <em>etc:paprika, chili flakes, curry powder</em>, and then having <strong>very</strong> hot oil poured over.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Belt Noodles</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Rice Vinegar</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place belt noodles in boiling water. Contrary to common practice in italian cuisine there is no need to salt the water.
            Boil until tender but still chewy.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a 1/4 cup of oil in a pot until just below smoke point.</li>
        <li>While noodles are boiling combine 2 tbsp Soy Sauce with 1 tbsp of Rice Vinegar, chop 3 cloves of garlic, and chop a 1in by 1in in knob of ginger. </li>
        <li>Drain cooked noodles and place desired amount into bowl. Pour sauce overnoodles, and place desired amount of garlic, ginger, and paprika on top of noodles.</li>
        <li>Now be very careful with this step. Slowly pour, or ladle, oil over the noodles, making sure to soak all of the spices and auromatics. </li>
        <li> Mix well and enjoy, hopefully, with chopsticks.</li>
    </ol>
